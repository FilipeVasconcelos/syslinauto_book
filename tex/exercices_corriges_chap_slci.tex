\question{\textbf{Décomposer $e_1(t)$ à l'aide de fonctions échelons.}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Le signal $e(t)$ est défini par :
\[
e_1(t)=\begin{cases}
    0&\quad t<0 \\
    t&\quad t\in[0,1]\\
    2-t&\quad t\in[1,3]\\
    t-4&\quad t\in[3,4]\\
    0&\quad t>4

On peut alors décomposer $e_1(t)$ en somme d'échelon :
\[
    e_1(t)=t    \left(u(t)-u(t-1)  \right)+(2-t)\left(u(t-1)-u(t-3)\right)+
         (t-4)\left(u(t-3)-u(t-4)\right)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
On rappel la transformée de Laplace d'une fonction retardée :
\[
    \laplace{f(t-\tau)} = e^{-\tau p}F(p)
\]
La transformée de Laplace de $\delta_a(t)$ est donc donnée par : 
\[
    \Delta_a(p) = \laplace{\delta_a(t)}
                = \dfrac{1}{a}\left(\laplace{u(t)}-\laplace{u(t-a)}\right)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question{\textbf{En considérant la limite $a\rightarrow0$, montrer que la

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Le développement limité d'ordre 1 de $e^{x}=1+x+o\left(x\right)$ permet de
déterminer la limite pour $a\rightarrow0$ de la transformée de Laplace de 
$\delta_a(t)$. En effet, 
\[
    \lim_{a\to0} \Delta_a(p) = \dfrac{1}{ap}(1-1+ap)=1.
\]
Puisque la transformée de Laplace d'une impulsion de Dirac est égale à 1, on a
bien vérifié que $\lim_{a\to0} \delta_a(p)=\delta(t)$ où $\delta(t)$ est 
l'impulsion de Dirac.

\question{\textbf{Déterminer la transformée de Laplace $Q(p)$ de la charge au

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle de la décharge d'un
condensateur est donnée par :
\[
    \tau(pQ(p)-q_0)+Q(p)=0
\]
où $q_0$ est la condition initialle de $q(t)$.
La résolution algébrique de cette équation nous donne 
\[
    Q(p)(\tau p+1)=q_0\tau
\]
ou encore :
\[
    Q(p)=q_0\dfrac{\tau}{\tau p+1}
\]
Remarquons que cette solution ne dépend que des conditions initiales, il n'est 
pas possible de définir une fonction de transfert dans ce cas particulier.

Pour déterminer la solution $q(t)$ de l'équation différentielle, il suffit de 
déterminer la transformée inverse de $Q(p)$.

La transformée inverse de la fonction $F(p)=\dfrac{1}{p+a}$ est $f(t)=e^{-a}$.
Donc sous la forme,
\[
    Q(p)=q_0\dfrac{1}{p+\dfrac{1}{\tau}},
\]
la transformée inverse de $Q(p)$ est simplement donnée par 
\[
    q(t)=q_0e^{-\dfrac{t}{\tau}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
La transformée de Laplace de l'équation différentielle nous donne : 
\[
    Z(p)\left(mp^2+bp+k\right)=F(p)

\question{\textbf{Indentifier la fonction de transfert $H(p)$ du système et

On identifie simplement la fonction de transfert du système comme la fraction

\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{1}{mp^2+bp+k}
\]

Sous forme canonique, cette fonction de transfert s'écrit :
\[
    H(p)=\dfrac{1}{k\left(\dfrac{m}{k}p^2+\dfrac{b}{k}p+1\right)}

On sollicite le système par une impulsion de Dirac. Dans les faits, on peut 
voir cette sollicitation comme l'application d'une force $f(t)$ constante

\[

\question{\textbf{Déterminer les dimensions de ces paramètres quelques soient

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
L'étude dimensionnelle de l'équation différentielle nous permet d'identifier
les relations suivantes :
\[
    [a_1][s(t)] T^{-1} = [a_0][s(t)] = [b_0][e(t)].
\]
Ainsi $\tau$ a toujours la dimension d'un temps quelque soit la dimension des 
signaux d'entrée  $e(t)$ et de sortie $s(t)$.
\[
    [\tau] = \dfrac{[a_1]}{[a_0]}= T.
\]
La dimension du paramètre $K$ dépend elle du rapport des dimensions de ces 
signaux. En effet,
\[
    [K]=\dfrac{[b_0]}{[a_0]}=\dfrac{[s(t)]}{[e(t)]}

On peut dire que la dimension de la fonction de transfert est donnée par 
le paramètre $K$.

Notons que dans le domaine de l'automatique les fractions sont communément

\[
    H(p)=5.2\dfrac{0.0385p^2+0.385p+1}{0.066p^3+0.33p^2+0.733p+1}
